\textit{Advice 1}:\ For every problem in this class, you must justify your answer:\ show how you arrived at it and why it is correct. If there are assumptions you need to make along the way, state those clearly.
%\vspace{-3mm} 

\textit{Advice 2}:\ Verbal reasoning is typically insufficient for full credit. Instead, write a logical argument, in the style of a mathematical proof.\\

\textbf{Instructions for submitting your solution}:
\vspace{-5mm} 

\begin{itemize}
	\item The solutions \textbf{should be typed}, we cannot accept hand-written solutions. Here's a short intro to \href{http://ece.uprm.edu/~caceros/latex/introduction.pdf}{\textbf{Latex}.}
	 \item In this homework we denote the asymptomatic \textit{Big-O} notation by $\mathcal{O}$ and \textit{Small-O} notation is represented as $o$. 
	\item We recommend using online Latex editor \href{https://www.overleaf.com/}{\textbf{Overleaf}}. Download the \textbf{.tex} file from Canvas and upload it on overleaf to edit.
	%todo add link of gradescope
	\item You should submit your work through \href{https://www.gradescope.com}{\textbf{Gradescope}}  only.
	\item If you don't have an account on it, sign up for one using your CU email. You should have gotten an email to sign up. If your name based CU email doesn't work, try the identikey@colorado.edu version. 
	\item Gradescope will only accept \textbf{.pdf} files (except for code files that should be submitted separately on Canvas if a problem set has them) and \textbf{try to fit your work in the box provided}. 
	\item You cannot submit a pdf which has less pages than what we provided you as Gradescope won't allow it.

	    (5 pts) You are given a list of jobs with start and end times. Assume that only one job can be executed at a time on a processor. Your task is to find out the minimum number of processors required so that the jobs are  executed as soon as they arrive (no waiting time for a process).
	    The input to your algorithm will be a list of tuples indicating the start and end times of the respective jobs. The output should be a number indicating the minimum number of processors required. Your algorithm should have a runtime of $\mathcal{O}(n \log(n))$, where $n$ is the number of jobs. Assume you do not have access to any auxiliary functions.\\

		\item{
    (20 pts) There are an even number of items arranged along a line. Each item has a value $v_i$ associated with it. You are competing against an opponent to collect items such that total value of your items collected is maximized. At each round of the game, one player is allowed to pick an item from either end of the line. \\ \\
    Determine the maximum total value that can be obtained, if you are allowed to play first assuming that the opponent is equally clever. The input to your algorithm will be a list of values. The output should be a number indicating the maximum amount of value that you can obtain.\\ 
    
    \textbf{Example} \\
    \textbf{Input}: $22, 43, 10, 20$ \\
    \textbf{Output}: $63$ \\
    \textbf{Explanation}: As the first player I would first pick 20 from the right end. The opponent would then pick 22. Out of the two elements 43, 10 remaining, I can pick 43. Thus 20+43=63 is the maximum total value that can be obtained. \\
    \textbf{Note}: Observe in the above example that the greedy choice of picking the max valued item does not work. If I had picked 22 instead of 
    20 in the first round, the maximum value that I could have obtained is 32.
