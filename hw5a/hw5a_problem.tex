		\textit{Advice 1}:\ For every problem in this class, you must justify your answer:\ show how you arrived at it and why it is correct. If there are assumptions you need to make along the way, state those clearly.
		%\vspace{-3mm} 
		
		\textit{Advice 2}:\ Verbal reasoning is typically insufficient for full credit. Instead, write a logical argument, in the style of a mathematical proof.\\

		\textbf{Instructions for submitting your solution}:
		\vspace{-5mm} 
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The solutions \textbf{should be typed}, we cannot accept hand-written solutions. Here's a short intro to \href{http://ece.uprm.edu/~caceros/latex/introduction.pdf}{\textbf{Latex}.}
			\item In this homework we denote the asymptomatic \textit{Big-O} notation by $\mathcal{O}$ and \textit{Small-O} notation is represented as $o$. 
			\item We recommend using online Latex editor \href{https://www.overleaf.com/}{\textbf{Overleaf}}. Download the \textbf{.tex} file from Canvas and upload it on overleaf to edit.
			%todo add link of gradescope
			\item You should submit your work through \href{https://www.gradescope.com}{\textbf{Gradescope}}  only.
			\item If you don't have an account on it, sign up for one using your CU email. You should have gotten an email to sign up. If your name based CU email doesn't work, try the identikey@colorado.edu version. 
			\item Gradescope will only accept \textbf{.pdf} files (except for code files that should be submitted separately on Canvas if a problem set has them) and \textbf{try to fit your work in the box provided}. 
			\item You cannot submit a pdf which has less pages than what we provided you as Gradescope won't allow it.

		(20 pts) Assume you're given an integer matrix that representing islands in an ocean. A value of 0 in a particular cell indicates water and a value of 1 indicated land. An island is region of land connected vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.  The size of an island is the total number of connected land cells.
